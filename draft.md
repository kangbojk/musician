How not to quit
    transcribe music
    sing
    find the music that you can easily play through it (Hisaishi)
    record some meme video
    find interesting sheet
    play different genre
    play other instrument
    watch other play what you're playing
    share your progress
    play public piano(try different piano)

*Ergonomics
    plays good but hurts yourself in the long run means nothing
    Find a nice chair
    Adjust your sheet height

Before July 2021, I couldn't imagine myself playing piano.

## Why write this?
I started playing piano in the middle of July 2021. 

Before I forgot the beginner's mind I would like to share some tips for those who want to learn piano by themselves in a beginner's perspective.

Most of the approach I used is based on my research, it might contain some experiments. Free feel to discuss about it.

Also, this project adopt "learn in public" ethos, not only demostrate my result but also track my learning journey. I'll try to update my progress every season.

## Background
This project is meant to give direction to those who want to self-taught piano, get to know some of my background might be helpful.

I used to learn violin when I was 12.
Learned about 1.5 years in a after school talent studio.

I thought I played nice back then, but actually lack of proper training.

Since most of the after school class charge according to student's progress, they try to skip fundentmental practice and move to pieces.

I'm not those kid who will take music as their major later, teacher can tell it.
I have zero music theory knowledge when I learned violin, explaining music concept with piano to me make no sense.
So they just some sheet that I could play but not really helpful for basic skills.

I was happy to play a entire song when I was a kid, but lack of fundemental training makes me sound like sawing after dropping violin for 10 years.

One of the problem of talent school is teacher show you how to play, but didn't really tell you why play like that.

Probably no one tell them either.

There's at less three types of bow holding position, but not until I found books about violin pedagogy in library recently that I know their difference.

Neither will they examain ergonomics.

Honestly, we use a weird position to play violin.

To prevent bending our neck to much and support violin, we use a shoulder rest.

But the length of nack different from man to man.

And sweat.

Asia is hot. Expecially Taiwan.

When you practiced violin in summer, chin rest got really slippery. I found the metal part of my violin is rusted after years of sweat.(?)

I know nothing about shoulder when I was a kid, so the shoulder rest always slipped after play several minutes.

Not until recently I found I might need a higher shoulder rest to better support my violin.

You need to get feedback when you learn something new, but the feedback don't have to be teacher.

Don't leave the obligation of learning to your teacher, they won't care before you spend time working on it.

And did I learn piano before? Presumbably yes. Too short to remember. 

I couldn't recall if I have a piano teacher. But my mom did teach me.

She is not a piano teacher, I'm not a prodigy. 

I don't know how to learn, she don't know how to teach, you could tell the result.

All this weird previuos experience make me think I couldn't play piano. Things related to music had been into oblivion for decade.

Until July 2021.
