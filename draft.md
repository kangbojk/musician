Before July 2021, I couldn't imagine myself playing piano.

## Why write this?
I started playing piano in the middle of July 2021. 

Before I forgot the beginner's mind, I would like to share some tips in a beginner's perspective for those who want to learn piano by themselves.

Most of the approach I used is based on my research, it might contain some experiments. Free feel to discuss about it.

Also, this project adopt "learn in public" ethos, not only demostrate my result but also track my learning journey. I'll try to update my progress every season.

## Background
This project is meant to give direction to those who want to self-taught piano, get to know some of my background might be helpful.

I used to learn violin when I was 12.
Learned about 1.5 years in a after school talent studio.

I thought I played nice back then, but actually lack of proper training.

Since most of the after school class charge according to student's progress, they try to skip fundentmental practice and move to pieces.

I'm not those kid who will take music as their major later, teacher can tell it.
I have zero music theory knowledge when I learned violin, explaining music concept via piano to me make no sense.
So teacher just assign some sheet that I could play but not really helpful for basic skills.

I was happy to play a entire song when I was a kid, but lack of fundemental training makes me sound like sawing after dropping violin for 10 years.

One of the problem of talent school is teacher show you how to play, but didn't really tell you why play like that.

Probably no one tell them either.

There's at less three types of bow holding gesture, but not until I found books about violin pedagogy in library recently that I know their difference.

Neither will they examine ergonomics.

Honestly, we use a weird position to play violin.

To prevent bending our neck to much and support violin, we use a shoulder rest.

But the length of nack different from man to man.

And sweat.

Asia is hot. Expecially Taiwan.

When you practiced violin in summer, chin rest got really slippery. I found the metal part of my violin is rusted after years of sweat.(?)

I know nothing about shoulder when I was a kid, so the shoulder rest always slipped after playing several minutes.

Not until recently I found I might need a higher shoulder rest to better support my violin.

You need to get feedback when you learn something new, but the feedback don't have to be teacher.

Don't leave the obligation of learning to your teacher, they won't care before you spend time working on it.

And did I learn piano before? Presumbably yes. Too short to remember. 

I couldn't recall if I have a piano teacher. But my mom did teach me.

She is not a piano teacher, I'm not a prodigy. 

I don't know how to learn, she don't know how to teach, you could tell the result.

All this weird previous experience make me think I couldn't play piano. Things related to music had been into oblivion for decade.

Until July 2021.

## How it start
The two main factor that broughts me to piano is COVID and Dr.K.

The world turned upside down because of COVID, human faced a situation that never appeared.

People's behavior changed. Remork work, wearing mask, couch potato...

So am I.

I spent more time on online video platform.

In a conincidence, I clicked a video with a casual thumbnail but millions of views.

Ok, playing piano is public, let's see how good he plays

I didn't know those videos will change me. "THOSE" because the video just link to another and another, all of them are a whited hair dude with a sunglass playing piano in public.

Great piano player are over the world, you can easily find someone who plays amazing music in your town.

But those who plays and effect your emotions and makes you want to dance is spare.

I have no idea about boogie-woogie before, but vivid rhythm and characteristic swing caught my attention.

I ended up checking through most of the dude's video, and deeply hooked.

How can you troll a passenger with "where is the middle C?" and them plays amazing boogie woogie improvisation to shock them?

The boogie woogie piano video get into my browser in early July, one week later, I said to myself, "Shit, I have to learn playing boogie woogie"


## Atomic habit
Although I have the eager to learn boogie woogie, I have no clue how to get started.
I don't have much piano experience, but I thought at least I need to practice some fundemental and read the sheet in order to play boogie woogie.

An approach I used I found helpful is I tried to build a habit instead of merely learning a instrument.

If you tried to learn a instrument, you'll somehow quit it. However, when you build a habit, it sticks in your life.

I couldn't recall which day and what I played in the first(that's why I want to write down my experience incase I forgot what I've overcame), probably just bashing some notes on piano.

It's uncomfortable when you kickstart a new habit, the book "Atomic Habit" give you nice insights about how you should start your new habit.

So I started small.

The piano stood at their for over decades, but the last time I heard someone played it is probably more than five years ago when my younger still have a piano class.\

I found some "children's Beyer" on top of piano, full of dust.

Playing the notes feel awkward, completely different from what I seen on YouTube.

Let's do it gradually, I told myself.

First day is embarassing.

Second day is my awkward.

Third, forth, fifth... After a week, it feels natural.

I didn't shout out loudly to the world that I'm going to learn piano, I just play it.
Start small and simple.

My parents did show some curious, but later on they just go back to play their phone.

I played several minutes in the very beginning and have no stable rountine, but after several days, I manage to play it consistently in fixed schedule.

There's my schedule before and after playing piano for your reference.

By the way, I have no idea about whether it's good to use Beyer as your first book. 

I could only find children's Beyer and I have no knowledge about piano method books so I just used what I found. 

I will share some books I used but try to explore different materials to expand your taste.


# Mindset

Build a habit instead of try learning a instrument is a great mindset, and I'll share some other mindsets that you could try to keep yourself progressing.

After you successfully started the habit as the first step of your music journey, you'll have to think about how to practice properly and improve as an intermediate player.

The most important one is keep the music played (aka. How not to quit). Let me share some tips I used to keep the music flow.

## How not to quit
    transcribe music
    sing
    find the music that you can easily play through it (Hisaishi)
    record some meme video
    find interesting sheet
    play different genre
    play other instrument
    watch other play what you're playing
    share your progress
    play public piano(try different piano)

## Move out your comfort zone

## Break into small parts

## Use technology/tools
