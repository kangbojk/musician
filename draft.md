    find interesting sheet
    play different genre
    play other instrument
    watch other play what you're playing
    share your progress
    play public piano(try different piano)

*Ergonomics

    Find a nice chair
    Adjust your sheet height


Mindset
    keep the music played
    move out your comfort zone
    break into small parts
